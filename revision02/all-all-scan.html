        <p><a href="http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/~walkerb/classes/intro/media/stages_language.mov">Stages</a> - this discusses the basic stages of language acquisition from early exposure, babbling, one and two word utterances. </p>

        <p>Statistical learning - Here are sound demos that suggest that infants (and tamarins) can learn the sequential probabilities that can guide the segmentation of the speech stream into words. </p>

        <p><a href="http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/~walkerb/classes/intro/media/stream.wav">Stream</a> - here the phonetic segments are played continuously and "words" are those sequences of segments that are consistent (e.g., tudaro) and nonwords are those that are not consistent (pabiku).  Consistency here means that /tu/,/da/, and /ro/ always appear together, where as /pa/, /bi/, and /ku/ occur together sometimes but often they don't.   Infants pick up on this and it probably is critical in getting the word learning process started.

    <div class="content">

        <p>Today we will first introduce the course and some basic methodological issues in psychology. There will also be a presentation on the departmental research participation requirement. We will then will be looking at a part of our life that we have little access to, sleeping. We will, in looking at this issue, also get some exposure to a range of isssues, methodologies and approaches that are used in psychology. One question we will ask is whether and why we need to sleep.</p>

        <p>The major topics we will be discussing include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Defining sleep</li>
            <li>Sleep as a behavior</li>
            <li>The behavior and role of the brain in the control of sleep</li>
            <li>Theories of sleeping (why we sleep)</li>
            <li>The necessity of sleep--do we need to do it?</li>

    <div class="title"><span>Sleeping and dreaming</span></div>
    <div class="content">

        <p>Today we will be finish our discussion of sleep and then focus on interesting behavior that occurs within it; dreaming. We will complete any issues remaining from our discussion of sleep and then, with regard to dreaming, the basic question we will ask is what can we learn from our dreams? We will examine whether dreams are meaningful, whether they are "true" or predictive and how they differ from our other experiences.</p>

        <p>The major topics we will discuss include the following:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Dreams as behavior--characteristics and description</li>
        <li>Brain function during dreaming</li>
        <li>Rapid Eye Movements and dreaming</li>
        <li>Theories of dreaming starting with dreams as meaningful events (the psychoanalytic perspective)</li>

    <div class="title"><span>Dreaming, intro to nervous system</span></div>
    <div class="content">

        <p>Today in lecture we will focus on dreaming, trying to answer a basic question: what can we learn from our dreams? We will examine whether dreams are meaningful, how they differ from our other experiences and whether they are "brain events" or "mind events". Having started on this topic last class, we will begin with the "Who dreams" and "Theories of dreaming" topics below.</p>

        <p>The major topics we will be discussing include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Dreams as behavior--characteristics and description</li>
            <li>Brain function during dreaming</li>
            <li>Rapid Eye Movements and dreaming</li>
            <li>Who dreams?</li>
            <li>Theories of dreaming:
                <ul>
                    <li>The psychoanalytic theory (Freud) (Accompanied by a brief intro to psychoanalysis)</li>
                    <li>The Hall/Cartwright confirmations of and revisions to Freud</li>
                    <li>Implications of the Dement and Kleitman (REM) work</li>
                    <li>Physiological theories of dreaming (purging connections, sorting memory, random, activation-synthesis, memory storage, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will conclude with the question of whether can we obtain meaningful insights about ourselves through our dreams? With regard to scientific methodology in psychology, some of the discussion will occur in lecture and what we don't cover there, in recitation. The following are the core topics.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Basic Methodology
                <ul>
                    <li>Experiments: independent and dependent variables</li>

    <div class="content">

        <p>Today we will be completing the discussion of factors that "move us" or underlie or energize our behavior, namely, our motivations. We made a start on this topic Tuesday, so today we will be starting from the 4th point below. For this portion of the lecture we'll use the slide set from Tuesday's class, starting with slide no. 29. Please note that the slide set has been modified a bit so it is worth downloading the new set.</p>

        <p>We will examine the following motivational issues:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The major functions of motivation (activation of the organism, directing it towards a goal, and enhancing performance)</li>
            <li>A typology of motivations: the major types and an interesting idea about how they relate to one another</li>
            <li>Yerkes-Dodson Law</li>
            <li>The evolution of the adaptive mechanism of homeostatic control and how control systems operate</li>
            <li>A basic model of the functioning of primary (physiological) drives, how they fit into the above model, and why they are so important and adaptive</li>
            <li>Some examples of non-homeostatic motivations and how they fit into an overall structure of our motivations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will then briefly discuss some basic models of emotion.</p>

    <div class="title"><span>Sensory systems, especially vision</span></div>
    <div class="content">

        <p>We are at the beginning of a new section of the course. While the first section focused on the underlying basis of our behavior, the focus of this section will be on our thinking. We will start with the input to the process, sensing and perceiving the world. This of course was an issue in the last section of the course where we saw that behavior often began with a stimulus that had to be sensed (think of the knee jerk example or a taxis). The specific focus today will be on an introduction to some of the major conceptual issues that will frame our analysis of perception, psychophysics, and the auditory system.</p>

        <p>Specific topics include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The nativist-empiricist debate (does all information come in via the senses or is some innate)?</li>
            <li>Top-down and bottom-up perception and the issue of why we don't see the world as it is</li>
            <li>The ear and audition</li>
            <li>Volley and Place theories of hearing</li>
            <li>Operating characteristics of the auditory system</li>
            <li>Psychophysics: measuring the response of sensory systems, including absolute and difference thresholds</li>
            <li>The just noticeable difference (jnd) and Weber's and Fechner's law</li>

    <div class="title"><span>Visual processing</span></div>
    <div class="content">

        <p>In today's lecture we will complete our discussion of vision and visual information processing, and then proceed to consider perception at a higher level (moving from peripheral sensory processes into some brain processes). In particular, we will move from the underpinnings or workings of bottom up perceptual processes toward a discussion of some of the mechanisms underlying top down, contextually driven processes, and discuss how they work together to actively perceive the world. Finally, given time, we will introduce the topic of attention. The slides are the set from last time starting at slide 53.</p>

        <p>Specific topics include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Operating characteristics of the visual system. Some operating characteristics of the eye (in addition to its duplex nature, sensitivity and acuity), adaptation, etc.)</li>
            <li>Color vision.</li>
            <li>Lateral inhibition and a focus on sensing spatial and temporal change in the world
            <li>The analysis of visual inputs--some brain functions in feature detection</li>
            <li>Top-down and bottom-up processes in perception</li>
            <li>Some examples of active perception</li>
            <li>Contextually driven perceptual processes--the analysis of visual inputs. From lateral inhibition to frogs and cats: neural functioning in feature detection.</li>
            <li>Feature detection in cats and humans: the same kinds of features when you do single cell recording (cats) or stabilized retinal images (humans).</li>
            <li>Other examples of feature detection</li>

    <div class="title"><span>Attention and immediate memory</span></div>
    <div class="content">

        <p>In today's lecture we will briefly examine the topic of attention, some of its associated behavior and basic models, and then memory and the processes that accomplish it. The overiding issue we will be examining is what constitutes memory--what is it and what functions does it serve for us. Having looked in the last lecture at how information "gets in" (perception) we'll now consider how it is attended to and stored for use. In addition, we will be taking a much broader view of memory and what it does for us. We'll also examine a multi-store model of memory that divides it up into shorter term and longer term subparts.</p>

        <p>Specific topics include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Basic conceptions of attention: Filter, spotlight, and capacity limitation</li>
            <li>Very short memories: sensory storage</li>
            <li>Somewhat longer term storage: Short term memory (STM)--a fundamental bottleneck in our thinking
                <ul>
                    <li>What it can hold</li>
                    <li>How things leave it</li>
                    <li>How we search for things within it</li>
                    <li>Another way of looking at it (STM vs Working Memory)</li>
                    <li>The "bottleneck" issue</li>
                    <li>Beating the bottleneck--some extreme cases!</li>

    <div class="content">

        <p>In today's lecture we will continue the study of memory and the processes that accomplish it. Our focus will be on sensory storage and then mainly on short term or working memory (including what distinguishes the two).</p>

        <p>The slides for today include slides 13 to 20 from last time and then the new ones (which overlap those from last Thursday from slide 20 on, but go further).</p>

        <p>Specific topics include:</p>

    <div class="title"><span>Long-term memory and thinking</span></div>
    <div class="content">

        <p>In today's lecture we will complete our discussion of STM and consider issues related to the transfer of information into long term memory and then the operation (and a model) of LTM itself.</p>

        <p>Specific topics include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Making things permanent: transfer into Long Term Memory: Rehearsal, Elaborative rehearsal and organization</li>
            <li>Encoding specificity-the effect of context: Godden & Baddeley exper</li>
            <li>Codes in memory and thought</li>

            <li>What happens if you can't transfer info to LTM?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Finally, we will examine a model of memory storage (for at least verbally encoded symbolic memories) and some experimental evidence for it. We will also consider how this model can provide an account for a range of memory phenomena as well as how this provides a basis for thought.</p>

    <div class="title"><span>Thinking and problem solving</span></div>
    <div class="content">

        <p>In today's lecture we will describe some different problem types.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Well-defined vs. ill-defined problems: Problems where the goal or solution is recognizable--where there is a right answer (ex. a math or physics problem) vs. problems where there is no "right" answer but a range of more or less acceptable answers (ex. design a building or write good short story)</li>

            <li>Knowledge rich vs. knowledge lean problems: problems whose solution depends on specialized knowledge (ex. What is the weight of a liter of carbon dioxide at 1 atmosphere pressure and 40 degrees C?) vs. problems that do not depend on such knowledge (ex. How many weighings on a two pan balance does it take to decide which of 12 similar appearing balls is heavy or light?)</li>

            <li>Insight vs. non-insight problems (those presumably solved "all of a sudden" vs. those solved more incrementally--in a step by step fashion</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will also describe some classic work on problem-solving that arose out of the Gestalt tradition in psychology and is also having a continuing effect today.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Functional fixedness (the string problem)</li>
            <li>Problem-solving set (Luchins' work-the water jar problem)</li>
            <li>Memory for interrupted problems (the Zeigarnik effect)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will then move on to focus on the "modern" period of problem-solving research. New work: the Simon and Newell part of the cognitive revolution in the 1950's. We will be focusing on these issues:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Problem solving as search and the size of the search space</li>
            <li>Methodology: Verbal protocols and computer simulation</li>
            <li>Problem difficulty and the kind of representation the problem-solver uses in solving the problem</li>
            <li>Cognitive processing limitations and our ability to solve difficult problems</li>
            <li>Algorithms and heuristics, including some common heuristics or weak (general) methods, such as total enumeration or trial and error, hill climbing, means-ends-analysis, working backwards, fractionation or subgoaling, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Today in lecture, we will complete our discussion of problem solving and expertise, using the remaining slides from the last class. We will then introduce a human ability that many argue separates us from the animals: the ability to use and understand language. We will only be doing the first portion of the material this Tuesday and the remainder on Thursday.</p>

        <p>Here are some of the major themes we will touch on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What is the purpose of language? Why do we speak?</li>
            <li>Does language separate us from non-human animals? What distinguishes human language from animal communication?</li>
            <li>Characteristic features of language: generative, displacement, recursive, combinatorial, creative, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As described in the Pinker paper, language gives us an amazing power to direct the thoughts and attention of other people. This skill is a foundation of our social and cultural existence!</p>

<li class="topic">
    <div class="title"><span>Attitude and beliefs</span></div>
    <div class="content">

        <p>The discussion today will conclude our discussion of development with an examination of cognitive development (remaining slides from Tuesday's class) begin our focus on social psychology, including many of the social influences and interactions that determine who and what we "are"; the forces that shape our thoughts and behavior.</p>

        <p>Our major focus today will be on the study of attitudes (how they are formed, maintained and changed). Attitudes include cognitive (belief) aspects, evaluative aspects (they have a "for" or "against" component) and tendencies to behave (policy orientations). The major theme of the lecture is about how we strive for consistency among our various attitudes; the amazing lengths to which we go in order to maintain that consistency.</p>

        <p>The maintenance of consistancy, how do we do it?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Selective exposure</li>
            <li>Selective interpretation</li>
            <li>Selective memory/forgetting</li>
            <li>The culmination of this is consistency theory, for example, Heider's balance theory</li>
            <li>How all this plays a role in stereotyping and prejudice</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Changing attitudes; persuasion and propaganda (inside and outside of elections!)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Characteristics of the source of a message</li>
            <li>Characteristics of the message</li>
            <li>Characteristics of the recipient</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Techniques for obtaining compliance/attitude change</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Justification of the request for compliance</li>
            <li>Reciprocity-create an obligation</li>
            <li>Low-ball (obtain committment before upping the ante/price)</li>

            <li>Door in the face</li>
            <li>"That's not all"--add something to sweeten the deal at the last moment</li>
            <li>"Hard to get/exclusive"--"You are only one of five people to get this special offer..."</li>
            <li>Prestige suggestion--Everyone (or famous people) are doing it</li>

<li class="topic">
    <div class="title"><span>Attitude consistency theories</span></div>
    <div class="content">
    
        <p>Today we will examine the surprising issue of attitude consistency and a number of theories that account for it. The following theories are all based on the idea that we strive for consistency in our attitudes, beliefs and behavior. While they each have a different focus (on behavior or on attitude for example) they all express aspects of attitude consistency and can thus be labeled as consistency theories.</p>

        <p>Balance theory, Self Perception & Cognitive Dissonance Theory. These are all cognitive consistency theories and we will examine not only the theories, but also how these theories call into question our independence of thought, and raise frightening issues about how capable of being socially influenced or malleable we might be.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Balance theory (Heider) Focus on attitude congruence</li>
            <li>Cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger) Three types of dissonance situations:
                <ul>
                    <li>Consequence of decision (Brehm) + post decision dissonance at post time. (Knox & Inkster)</li>
                    <li>Justification of effort (Aronson & Cope)</li>
                    <li>External-internal justification Festinger. & Carlsmith severity of threat (Aronson & Carlsmith--toy experiment)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Self perception theory (Bem) and experimental evidence: (Valins, Lepper et al. counterattitudinal advocacy)</li>
            <li>How the foot in the door and door in the face phenomena illustrate the operation of self perception theory.</li>

<li class="topic">
    <div class="title"><span>Social influence: conformity, obedience, and personality</span></div>
    <div class="content">
    
        <p>We have examined a number of ways in which our attitudes can be manipulated or changed by outsiders in considering propaganda (and even high pressure automobile sales!) and also at some of the more internal cognitive consistency processes that act to distort our attitudes and beliefs (balance theory and cognitive dissonance theory). We've thus seen ways in which we appear to be weak minded, other directed (Riesman) and easily manipulated by others and by some of our own characteristic behaviors. Today we will complete our discussion of one last consistancy theory, self perception theory. We will then push this issue of our susceptibility to social influence much further in today's lecture when we examine conformity and obedience, to examine the point where we become downright dangerous to each other and to ourselves. But as we do this, it is important to be aware that there is also a danger on the other side--the idealogue who is absolutely convinced of his or her own ideas and willing to go to great lengths and sacrifice much (including others) for his/her ideas. We take a look at these issues now, starting with fairly mild processes and working our way up to the more serious, and finally think a bit about how we might overcome this problem?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Self Perception Theory (Bem)</li>
            <li>Bystandar Apathy (Latane and Darley)</li>
            <li>Conformity (Asch)</li>
            <li>Obedience (Milgram)</li>
            <li>Jonestown, suicide bombers, etc.</li>
            <li>Korean POW study</li>
            <li>What cuts across it all? Schein's work on Korean War POWs. Social isolation is the key. Are there ways of checking it out with others without simply conforming? Are there possible inner codes that can allow us to go on without the excesses that are so common? --There have to be. Finding them is a central challenge of the human condition/dilemma.</li>

<li class="topic">
    <div class="title"><span>Nature, nurture, and aggression</span></div>
    <div class="content">
    
        <p>The discussion today focuses primarily on some alternative explanations for human aggression after we complete our discussion of obedience. We will first consider a socio-biological explanation that holds that aggression is a normal part of animal behavior (including that of humans) but that human aggression differs due to lack of a safeguard that protects animals against aggression from members of their own species. The basic argument is that animals that are dangerous to each other (that have deadly natural "weapons") have safeguards against excessive maiming or killing such as surrender gestures that ward off further aggression or even ritualized combat where they do not really fight. Non-dangerous animals do not need these safeguards and are less likely to have them. According to this ethological view, humans have, via the invention of weapons as a cultural change, become very dangerous without the evolution of safeguards.</p>

        <p>The alternative viewpoint is a more human-based one, that argues that humans are dangerous to each other not because our behavior resembles aspects of animal behavior, but mainly because of its uniquely human characteristics. The argument is that through our dependence on symbols and on tight social units, evil leaders can incite aggression through appealing to our loyalty to our "group" whatever that might be (religion, nationality, tribe, etc.) and that our brain physiology is such that aggressive centers can be aroused so that our killing arises out of love of our ingroup rather than originating in hatred of the outgroup, although the effect might be the same.</p>

        <p>We finally will turn to a consideration of whether there are parallels between some of the relevant social behaviors of humans and of animals to test whether the sociobiological approach has even face validity.</p>

        <p>If there is time we will introduce the topic of personality theory as well toward the end of the lecture.</p>

        <p>The discussion today will first clear up a few remaining issues from the last lecture on aggression and related behaviors and then present an overview of personality, including ways of looking at what constitutes personality, the issue of stable personality vs. situationalism (whether personality is stable or lasting) and then some major theories of personality. The focus will then turn to an overview of psychopathology. We will introduce two basic stances or perspectives that are taken with regard to disorders; a biological/medical model and a psychological/experiential one and will consider the following topics from the above two viewpoints:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Definitions of abnormality and their implications for therapy</li>
